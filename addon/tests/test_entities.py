# Golden entity counts per device type. An entity's identity in Home Assistant
# is its unique_id, so silently dropping, adding or renaming one orphans it in
# every live installation and loses its recorded history. Changing a number
# here is allowed, but only ever deliberately.
# Changed 2026-07-29 by the unbacked-entity sweep (see tests/test_entity_backing.py).
# Every removal is backed by real firmware: the field's name appears nowhere in
# the extracted binaries, while every field kept beside it does. They came from
# the reference integration, which models PetKit's CLOUD API — whose field names
# are not the device's.
#   * litter -2: garbage_bag_state, purification_days (absent from T5 firmware);
#   * feeder  -2: feed_tone, disturb_mode (absent from D4SH firmware);
#   * the deodorizer and sound entities moved from the base litter/feeder lists
#     onto the camera-gated ones, which is where their defaults were already
#     seeded — so non-camera models no longer publish hardware they lack.
EXPECTED_ENTITY_COUNTS = {
    # Litter models dropped 5 on 2026-07-30: `sand_lack`, `weight_error`,
    # `frequent_use`, `low_power` and `litter_tray`, none of which any device
    # has ever filled (see the REMOVED note in ha/entities/sensors.py).
    #
    # Camera litters gained 6 on 2026-07-31: the `sensor{}` hall switches, read
    # live off a running T5. The W7H went 31 -> 61 the same day: its own field
    # map replaced nine entities it can never fill (filter, battery, `power`
    # buttons) with the 39 its `property/post` actually carries.
    #
    # 61 -> 67 on 2026-08-02: the three water-treatment buttons its `ctrl`
    # accepts as `start_action`, plus the three `event` entities its kinds fire
    # — which until then published to discovery topics it had never announced.
    #
    # The embedded-Linux feeders moved on 2026-08-08, from the two real D4SH
    # reports in issue #2 and that firmware's own state builder. Both lose four
    # controls nothing on this hardware fills (`food_low`, `food_in_bowl`,
    # `food_bowl_pct`, `battery_installed` — the device says `food1`/`food2`,
    # and `batV` rather than `batteryPower`) and gain the fields it does send.
    # 42 -> 50 on the D4H, which reports one hopper; the D4SH keeps its second
    # hopper sensor and adds the two per-hopper feed buttons and their portion
    # numbers, for 54.
    #
    # 2026-08-09, from two capture-derived settings maps (T6 and W7H) plus a
    # proxied T5. Every litter box gains `click_ok`; a camera one gains five
    # settings this add-on had been seeding and serving to the device with no
    # control for them (pet/wander/toilet detection, voice prompt, voice DND)
    # and three buttons (Light, Power Off, Power On) — 45 -> 46 and 73 -> 82.
    # The T6 is 83: it drops `reset_n50`, which it has no cartridge for and
    # whose code its own app uses for Pack, and adds Pack and Open Sealed Door.
    #
    # 67 -> 84 on the W7H: nine camera and voice switches (it had a camera
    # entity and no way to switch the camera off), the two drain cycles and
    # their two times, volume, voice language, and the same two power buttons.
    # t6 +6 on 2026-08-12: the bagging mechanism it reports in every
    # property post and nothing here read. No other litter box has it.
