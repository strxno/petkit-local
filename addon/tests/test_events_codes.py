"""Property tests over the protocol tables in events/codes.py.

These are deliberately properties rather than examples. The gap this module
exists to close was not "one code had the wrong label" -- it was that a code's
kind, label, detail-ness and anchor role lived in six separate collections, so
seven codes ended up in none of them and nobody noticed until a real device had
been reporting them for days. An example test would have to be written for each
new code to catch that; a property test catches the next one for free.
