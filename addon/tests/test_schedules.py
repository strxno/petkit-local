"""Schedules: what `dev_multi_config` serves, and what the panel's editor writes.

Two things this covers that nothing did before. `to_multi_config` used to build
its answer from literals and read no stored value at all, so every device was
handed the same made-up light period and quiet hours on every poll — and a
schedule set through the app in proxy mode was undone by the next one. And a
litter box's `schedule` array carries BOTH its cleaning and its deodorizing
times, told apart only by `type`, so an editor that rewrites its own section has
to keep the other one.
