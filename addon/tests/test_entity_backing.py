"""Every published entity must have something that can actually fill it.

An `EntityDef` whose `value_path` nothing can ever produce is published to Home
Assistant and to the panel, and then reads unknown forever — indistinguishable
from a device that simply has not reported yet. Four feeder controls shipped in
that state, and the only reason anyone noticed was someone looking at a blank
card.

This test is the durable form of that audit: it walks every codename and fails
when an entity is added without a backing field, instead of waiting for a user
to spot an empty control.
