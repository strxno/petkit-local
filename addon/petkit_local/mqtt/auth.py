"""Aliyun IoT HMAC-SHA256 authentication plugin for amqtt.

Device connects with:
  clientId: {pk}.{dn}|timestamp=XXXX,_ss=1,_v=sdk-python-1.0,securemode=2,signmethod=hmacsha256,ext=3,...|
  username: {dn}&{pk}
  password: HMAC-SHA256(deviceSecret, "clientId{pk}.{dn}deviceName{dn}productKey{pk}timestamp{ts}")

The signature is computed over the BARE `{pk}.{dn}` client id, not the full
pipe-delimited string the device actually connects with — getting that wrong
produces a mismatch on every device and is the first thing to check if auth
starts failing.

The device secret is ours, not Aliyun's: `http/handlers/iot_device_info.py`
generated it and told the device to use it, so a correct signature proves the
device talked to this add-on, and nothing more.
