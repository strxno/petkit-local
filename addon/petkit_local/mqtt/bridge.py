"""MQTT bridge: subscribes to device topics on the embedded broker,
parses Aliyun IoT events, and publishes state to HA MQTT.

MQTT and HTTP are two transports for the same conversation, not two channels
for different kinds of message. A device that reaches the broker STOPS polling
the HTTP heartbeat, so from that point everything it has to say — state, visit
and cleaning events, BLE relay frames — arrives here instead of at
`http/handlers/`, and `events/normalize.py` turns either form into the same row.

One thing is genuinely MQTT-only, and it is the reason to want a device here:
a command can be pushed the moment a user flips a control in HA
(`publish_to_device`), rather than waiting for the device to ask.

The bridge is a client of the EMBEDDED broker (`mqtt/broker.py`), not of Home
Assistant's; it hands what it parses to `ha/publisher.py`, which owns the HA
side. It holds ONE wildcard subscription covering every device, which is the
single most important thing to know here: anything that escapes per-message
handling takes down the bridge for all devices at once (see `_consume`).

The device-side event_type strings this module dispatches on (`pet_in`,
`clean_over`, ...) are NOT capture-confirmed — see `events/normalize.py`'s header
for what is. An unrecognised one degrades to "record it, publish state" rather
than failing.
