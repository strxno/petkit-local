    cut at a dot and handed over in two pieces:

        https://192.0.2.199:9000  ->  ("192", "0.2.199:9000")

    The cut is at the FIRST dot rather than the last, which matters for one

           lives in a different zone than its Home Assistant;

        3. the numeric offset the device reported at signup
           (`reported_timezone`), for a device that sent no usable locale;
        4. the container's clock, which the Supervisor sets from Home Assistant.

        The device is the authority on where IT is — it was handed a zone over
        BLE at provisioning and burns it into its video watermarks — so the two
        device-sourced values (2, 3) sit above the server's. But the NAME wins
        over the number, because a device that only ever got a locale and never
        a numeric offset reports that offset as 0: a box plainly in
        `Europe/Warsaw` telling us it is in UTC, which then had us serve UTC
        back and its scheduled feeds fire two hours late. The name it also sent

        an option: any fixed offset is wrong for half the year under DST — which
        is the same reason the name beats the frozen number even when both are
        present.

        Answering this correctly does not by itself fix the device's video
        watermarks — the firmware does not take its clock from this response.

        carrying `timezone` as a JSON STRING moves it, verified on a live T5.
