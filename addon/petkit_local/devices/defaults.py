"""The per-category seed data: what a device is served before anyone has spoken.

A codename selects a settings block, a set of schedule ranges and the editors
the panel offers for them, and all three are tables rather than behaviour. The
one rule they share is that a default may not decide anything on the owner's
behalf: a seeded value is served straight back to the device as its own
configuration, so an invented one is not a harmless placeholder but an
instruction. Where that rule bites, the comment below the table says so.
