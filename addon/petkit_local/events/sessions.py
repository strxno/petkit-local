"""Visit sessions and the Timeline's filter chips.

Where `events/normalize.py` turns a transport payload into a row, this module
reads those rows back — already stored, already classified — and groups them
into the cards the panel renders: a visit with its cleaning cycle folded
underneath, an "appeared" with its recognition result, a maintenance cycle with
its mechanism steps. Nothing here parses a transport; the only device payload it
touches is the `content`/`state` snapshot a stored row already carries.

Sessions are NOT persisted pre-grouped. `group_sessions` runs at query time, so
the grouping heuristic — which is all it is, and which real captures keep
correcting — stays in readable Python rather than in SQL.

    "Pet" and "Toileting" are DISJOINT, matching the official app (its own
    chips read e.g. "All 25 / Pet 5 / Toileting 7" — Pet is smaller than
    Toileting, which it couldn't be if visits were also counted as Pet):
    "Toileting" is a real visit, "Pet" is an episode where the pet was only
    seen ("appeared").

    "Health alert" is about the CAT, not the box. A hall-sensor fault or a
    jammed mechanism is a device problem and belongs under "Faults"; filing it
    as a health alert made the chip mean two unrelated things at once and buried
    the pet-health signal it exists for.

    It is also the reason this returns a set: a toilet visit where the cat
    YOWLED is both a visit and a health alert. PetKit's own description of
    Yowling Detection is that meowing in the box "may be caused by the cat's
    physical discomfort" and exists so you "spot potential health problems
    promptly" — so such a visit belongs under the health chip without ceasing
    to be a visit.

    Urine pH is deliberately NOT wired in yet. It would belong here — the app
    says an abnormal reading is surfaced in the timeline — but `ph_reason`'s
    values are undecoded: the feature was off for the whole reference capture,
    so 5 and 4 are its "not measured" codes and we cannot tell an abnormal
    reading from a missing one. Guessing would put a health warning on a
    healthy cat.

    Feeding, drinking and cleaning get chips of their own. Without them a
    feeder's and a fountain's cards belonged to no chip at all: they showed
    under "All" and were unreachable from every other filter, which is how a
    water refill came to be findable only by scrolling past it.
