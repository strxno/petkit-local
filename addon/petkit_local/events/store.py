"""Persistent event/media/pet store — SQLite via SQLAlchemy's async engine.

The schema lives in `events/models.py`; this module is only the queries. Two
properties of it are load-bearing:

* **Every method returns plain dicts**, never ORM instances — call sites index
  rows with `row["key"]`/`row.get("key")` and `query_timeline` synthesises an
  extra `"media"` key onto each event row.
* **Callers pass loose dicts.** Keys that are not writable columns are dropped
  silently (`_accepted`), so a payload the device grew a field in can never
  turn into an exception on the storage path.
