"""The PetKit protocol knowledge base: every event code, topic and enum we know.

This module is DATA, not behaviour. `events/normalize.py` normalizes transports,
`events/decode.py` renders values for humans, and both read their meaning from
here. Keeping it separate is what lets the panel's Debug view show *why* a
label says what it says: the confidence grade and the firmware provenance are
fields, not comments.

Seven namespaces, deliberately never merged
-------------------------------------------
NS1 `HTTP_EVENT_CODES`  -- numeric `event_type` on `POST /dev_event_report`.
NS2 `CLOUD_RECORD_TYPES`-- the PetKit *cloud*'s `LitterRecord.subContent[]
                           .eventType`. QUARANTINED: it overlaps NS1 on 5/8/10
                           with DIFFERENT meanings. Recorded so the collision
                           is documented; never consulted when labelling a
                           device report.
NS3 `MQTT_EVENT_TOPICS` -- `/sys/{pk}/{dn}/thing/event/{name}/post` suffixes.
NS4 `RECORD_TYPES`      -- media classification strings in cloud records.
NS5 `WORK_MODES` etc.   -- `state.workState.workMode`, the CURRENT operation.
NS6 `FEED_SRC` etc.     -- feeder dispensing sub-fields.
NS7 `ERROR_FLAGS`       -- the named bits inside a state report's `err{}`
                           object. Per device family, like NS1.

Where the two evidence sources disagree
---------------------------------------
Two independent sources feed this table, and they are authoritative for
different things:

  * A **firmware RE pass** over the T5's `/app/bin/{cloud,ctrl}` binaries is
    authoritative for a code's MEANING and NAME. Its `a0`/`v0` values are
    internal dispatch ids, NOT wire codes -- note that a0=4 is shared by four
    different operations -- so a mismatch in content SHAPE does not undermine
    the naming.
  * A **wire capture** (268 events, real T5 id=10000001 firmware 943,
    2026-07-22..27) is authoritative for content SHAPE on this firmware.

Every `EventCode.grade` records which of those two backs the row, and
`EventCode.note` records the disagreement verbatim when there is one. Nothing
here is inferred from a reference project alone; `grade="unverified"` marks a
row we have never seen on the wire.

The corpus that grades these rows
---------------------------------
Episode composition across all 268 captured events, which is what pins the
mechanism codes to the operation they belong to::

    23 x ('3','8')                          action=2  -> deodorizing cycle
    21 x ('17','3','5')                     action=0  -> cleaning cycle
    23 x ('17',)                                      -> solo cycle step
    23 x ('10','9')                                   -> the visit itself
    31 x ('20',)   31 x ('24',)                       -> appeared + result
     8 x ('1','2')                                    -> error raised/cleared
     1 x ('13','17','3','4','5')            action=0
     1 x ('13','14','15','16','3','4','7')  action=9  -> maintenance session

`action` therefore carries NS5's work mode: the action=0 episode terminates in
code 5 (cleaning done), the action=9 episode in code 7 (reset done), and
action=2 occurs exactly 23 times against 23 toilet visits. Code 8 co-occurs
with action=2 in 23 of 23 episodes and never with any other mode, which is why
it is "Deodorizing" and not "Cleaning started".

#: withheld the deodorizer event codes from two thirds of the models that have
#: the hardware. Deliberately NOT written as `LITTER_NEXT_GEN` even though the
#: two sets coincide today: "has an N60" and "is the newer generation" are
#: different claims and only one of them is about a consumable.
#:
#: NOT having an N60 does not mean not spraying. A model without the built-in

#: deodorizing function — consistent with `k3LightSwitch` appearing in a real
#: T4 property post, the T4 having no N60. So do not narrow anything
#: spray-shaped to this set on the assumption that the rest cannot spray; this
#: set is about the built-in consumable only. A K3's own consumables arrive as
#: `battery`/`liquid` LEVELS on its parent's report (`bridge._update_linked_k3`),
#: not as the reset date the N60 countdown uses, so the two are not

#:
#: Every entry is a single isolated tap in PetKit's app on a T6, captured and

#:
#: Read alongside `WORK_MODES`, four values agree outright (0, 1, 3, 4) and one
#: more agrees with pypetkitapi's LBCommand (7 LIGHT). **8 does not.** LBCommand
#: calls it RESET_N50_DEODOR; the tap that produced it was Pack, the
#: waste-packing cycle. The disagreement is not resolvable from here and it is
#: not cosmetic — one reading is a bookkeeping no-op and the other moves the
#: mechanism — so the row is graded `conflicted` and `ha/entities/buttons.py`
#: publishes the code under the name the tap gives it, on that model only.
#:

#: `cmp` chain out of the firmware, so a value outside it is known to be
#: ignored. This is a list of taps somebody made. 2, 9 and 10 are absent here
#: and are all real (deodorize, maintenance, N60 reset — 10 confirmed against

#: (2026-08-09): the array held four `type: 0` entries, and adding a periodic
#: DEODORIZING time appended a fifth with `type: 1` — same array, same write.
#:
#: Worth writing down precisely because every source up to now, ours included,
#: recorded `type` as "observed as 0; semantics unknown". Anything that edits
#: this array must filter by `type` and merge back, or it silently deletes the
#: other job's schedule.

# Time units in the settings block, because they are not one unit and the field
# names do not tell you which is which:
#
#   * MINUTES since midnight -- every `*MultiRange` (`lightMultiRange`,
#     `toneMultiRange`, `distrubMultiRange`, `awDisturbMultiRange`,
#     `wlDisturbMultiRange`, `cameraMultiRange[].time`) and `schedule[].time`.
#     A range whose end is below its start crosses midnight and is valid; a
#     one-minute range ([0, 1]) is valid too, so nothing may "tidy" these.
#   * SECONDS since midnight -- `flushTime` and `waterChangeTime` on a W7H.
#     The same settings block, the other unit.
#   * SECONDS as a duration -- `stillTime` (120 is the app's "2 min") and
#     `autoIntervalMin`, WHOSE NAME SAYS MINUTES AND MEANS SECONDS: PetKit's
#     app writes 300 for the UI's 5-minute minimum and 7200 for its 2-hour
#     maximum. See `ha/entities/selects.py`, where reading the name cost every
#     litter box a repeat-cleaning interval 60x shorter than the one chosen.
#
# All of them are LOCAL time; a T5 entry set at 14:50 in UTC+2 came out as 890.

#: A feeder's scheduled meals, which are a shape of their own.
#:
#: `dev_feed_get` answers with `{schedule: [...], nextTick, latest}`, where each
#: `schedule[]` entry is a GROUP of meals sharing weekdays:
#:
#:     {"re": "1,2,3,4,5,6,7", "it": [{"id": .., "t": .., "a1": .., "a2": ..}],
#:      "itemJsonString": "<the same it, as a string>"}
#:
#: Read out of a D4SH 867 `ctrl`, `pk_schmg_parse_schedule` in
#: `schedule_ctrl.c`: it looks up `result`, `schedule`, `latest`, then per group
#: `re` and `it`, then per item `id`, `t`, `a1` and `a2`. Its own log line names
#: what those become — `schdl_item[%d]:id = %7s,amount_l=%d,amount_r=%d,
#: time=%d,repeats=%d` — so `a1`/`a2` are the per-hopper portions, the same pair
#: a `feed_realtime` carries on this model, and `re` is the group's weekdays.
#:
#: `it` arrived POPULATED on 2026-08-12 — 21 proxied `dev_feed_get` responses
#: from the real cloud to a D4SH with meals set. They settle what the earlier
#: firmware read could not:
#:
#:   * The UNIT OF `t` IS SECONDS since local midnight — `n_46560` fired at
#:     12:56:00 — NOT the minutes every other schedule time on these devices
#:     counts (the litter box's `schedule[].time`, confirmed on our T5, is
#:     minutes). The id is `n_<that same seconds value>`.
#:   * `latest[]` holds the concrete feeds firing TODAY OR TOMORROW, id
#:     `s_YYYYMMDD_<secs>` (an instance of a recurring meal) or `d_...` (a
#:     one-off), with `t` a countdown in seconds from now, floored, recomputed
#:     every poll. `nextTick` is the countdown of the last `latest` entry, and
#:     the constant 86340 when `latest` is empty.
#:   * `itemJsonString` is NOT read by this parser. It is written alongside
#:     `it` anyway, because that is what the real cloud sends (keys in
#:     alphabetical order) and there is no reason to hand the device a payload
#:     a shape narrower than the one it knows.
FEED_SCHEDULE_ITEM_KEYS = ("id", "t", "a1", "a2")

#: The weekday numbering PetKit uses everywhere a schedule names days:
#: `schedule[].repeats`, `cameraMultiRange[].rpt` and their siblings.
#:

#: Sunday -> `"1"`, 02:22 Monday -> `"2"`, 03:33 Saturday -> `"7"`), and on our
#: own T5, where a deodorizing entry set for every day EXCEPT Monday came out as
#: `"1,3,4,5,6,7"`. Every schedule this add-on serves by default repeats on all

#: A FOUNTAIN's `action` is a different enum in the same field.
#:
#: This table exists because the one above was being applied to it. A W7H
#: `work_start` carries `action` (its content is
#: `{"pos","reason","item_id","action"}`), so `mode_from="action"` resolved,
#: and a refill rendered as "Odor removal - work started" — litter-box
#: vocabulary on a device that has no litter.
#:
#: Read out of W7H 456 `ctrl`. `work_start_event_detect` branches on the action
#: byte and each branch names itself, both in its log line and in the still it
#: grabs: `cmp #1` -> "get start event ---> flush water", `/tmp/fPro_flushStart.jpeg`;
#: `cmp #5` -> `/tmp/fPro_changeStart.jpeg`; everything else falls through to
#: "get start event ---> add water", `/tmp/fPro_addStart.jpeg`.
#:
#: So 1 and 5 are named by the firmware. 2 is not: it is accepted by the
#: command whitelist below but reaches the event detector's default branch, so
#: "refill" is the app's meaning attached to a value the firmware only lets
#: through. Graded accordingly — it is the one entry here that could be wrong.

#: value outside it returns without touching the work queue: no reply, no
#: error, no log. That is worth writing down precisely because it is
#: unobservable from here; a command with a wrong action looks identical to a
#: device that never got it.
#:
#: Only `start` is filtered this way. `stop_action`, `end_action` and

# --- NS7: err{} fault bits -------------------------------------------------

# Error sensor reads `taryF,cycL` — the device's own abbreviations, which say
# nothing to the person whose fountain has stopped.
#
# Only what a source names is listed. A bit with no entry falls back to its raw
# name rather than being dropped, so an unknown fault is still visible.

#: W7H (EverSweet Ultra AI). Two groups, one table, because both reach the same
#: Error sensor.
#:
#: The first eighteen are the `err{}` bits of a `property/post`. That set is
#: closed: the key list the payload builder walks is a single literal run in
#: W7H 456 `ctrl`, and it holds exactly these eighteen names — matching, name
#: for name, the `err` block of a real capture from the same device.
#:
#: The last seven never appear in `err{}` at all. They live in a separate run
#: (`cameraN|tankCU|tankDU|tankCL|tankDF|ptcU|tankL`) and are the content
#: strings an `error_start` EVENT carries. All twenty-five are referenced from
#: one code-to-name mapper, which is what says they are one vocabulary.
#:
#: The suffixes are regular, which is how the tank ones are readable at all:
#: L = missing/not detected, M = malfunction, U = not installed, F = full,
#: O = removed, D = detection. C is the clean tank and D the dirty one — the
#: same C/D split as the hall switches.

#: the key has to match what the device sends.
