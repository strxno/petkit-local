"""Catalogue mapping each device category to its HA entities and MQTT topics.

PetKit ships many device codenames but only four behavioural families: litter
box, feeder, water fountain, Pura Air spray. Everything a family contributes to
Home Assistant -- which entity lists it publishes, which extra ones a
camera-equipped model adds, and which MQTT event topics carry its state -- is
one `CATEGORY_SPECS` entry here, so supporting a new family is a row rather
than a fifth copy of the same skeleton.

The table is deliberately data, not code: the entity set it produces is the
user's Home Assistant state. A reordered or renamed entry orphans entities in
live installations and loses their recorded history, so `CategorySpec` composes
existing lists in a fixed order and never rewrites them.

This is also where a `Device` is asked what it publishes
(`get_entities_for_device` and friends). That question is an HA one, and
answering it from `devices/` is what had the device layer importing every
`ha/entities` module.
