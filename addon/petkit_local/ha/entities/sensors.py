"""HA `sensor` and `binary_sensor` entities for every device category.

These are the read-only half of the integration: each entry names a key under
`state.` in the document `ha/publisher.py::_build_state` publishes, which
`devices/state_parsers.py` fills from HTTP state reports and MQTT property
posts. Nothing here is settable — the writable side lives in switches.py,
numbers.py, selects.py and text.py.

A `value_path` pointing at a key a device *may* not report is fine: the template
defaults it and the entity reads empty until the device sends one, which is what
lets one list serve several firmware versions.

That is NOT a licence to publish an entity nothing can ever fill. A field no
state parser produces and no default seeds reads unknown forever, which a user
cannot tell apart from a device that has not reported yet — four such entities
shipped that way and were removed (see the note further down). The rule is
enforced by `tests/test_entity_backing.py`, which walks every codename.

`ha/categories.py` decides which of these lists a given device type gets.

# Everything here is a key in the state builder of a real D4SH 867 `ctrl` and is
# present in both of the real reports in issue #2. What each key MEANS is a
# separate question, and it is answered per entity below rather than in bulk:
# where nobody can say, the entity carries the device's own wording and no unit,
# because a sensor that reads confidently and lies is one you would act on.

#: The two hopper-level readings. DUAL-HOPPER ONLY, hence a D4SH-only list held
#: apart from FEEDER_NEXT_GEN_SENSORS the way FEEDER_DUAL_BUTTONS/NUMBERS are.
#:
#: They must be a separate list, not shared-and-excluded: `model_excludes` filters
#: only the family base, NOT `model_entities`, so excluding `hopper2_level` for a
#: D4H (as the code used to) never actually removed it. A single-hopper feeder
#: must simply not be GIVEN these — see `ha/categories.py`. A D4H is ASSUMED to
#: report the singular `food` instead (shown by the family `food_low`); that is
#: inference from the cloud model, unverified until a D4H is captured.
#:
#: 2 = has food and 0 = empty, reported by the D4SH owner, who never saw 1 in
#: between. So this is not a percentage, and it is not a two-state either until
#: somebody sees the middle value — hence an enum rather than the binary "Food
#: Low" the family already has. An unmapped value renders as the raw number
#: (`_enum_sensor_value_template`), so a 1 that does turn up is visible.

#: The raw hall switches behind the derived flags above, as diagnostics.
#:
#: Worth publishing separately because the derived flag can disagree with them
#: and the disagreement is the diagnosis: the real capture has `wtInstall`
#: reading 1 while `hall_DKR` reads 0, i.e. the waste tank is seated on one side
#: only. A user chasing "it says the tank is in but it won't flush" has no other
#: way to see that. (The pairing is `wtInstall` <- `hall_DKL`/`hall_DKR` and
#: `stgInstall` <- `hall_TY`, not the reverse — see the install block above.)
#:
#: Polarity is 1 = closed / magnet present / installed, as the firmware reports
#: it. The map warns that the exact NO/NC wiring may differ per pin, so these
#: carry no `device_class` — a wrong class would render an inverted pin as a
#: confident, wrong answer instead of a raw 0/1 somebody can compare against
#: what they just reseated.
