"""Translate HA entity commands into device commands.

Routing is driven by the entity definition (its `component` and `value_path`),
not by parsing an opaque payload. Every command that should reach the device
returns ``(service_suffix, mqtt_envelope)`` — the caller publishes it to
``/sys/{pk}/{dn}/thing/service/{suffix}`` (or falls back to the heartbeat queue
if the MQTT bridge is down). This matches the reference localkit stack, which
delivers ALL real-time control over MQTT `thing/service/*` topics, not heartbeat.

- **button**  -> a named action (litter start/end, feed, …).
- **switch/number/select** -> a settings write via `property.set`, with an
  optimistic local update so the HA entity reflects it immediately.
- **text** (schedules) -> raw JSON written to device config, served by
  dev_schedule_get / dev_feed_get.

Action codes and envelopes are cross-checked against pypetkitapi `LBCommand`
and localkit `ServiceStart/End/FeedRealtime/PropertySet`.

# Code 10 is now CONFIRMED against the real cloud on a T5. An N60 reset issued
# from PetKit's app arrived as, byte for byte in shape, what `_litter_start(10)`
# builds:
#   topic   /sys/{pk}/{dn}/thing/service/start
#   payload {"method":"thing.service.start","id":"1732816215",
#            "params":{"start_action":10},"version":"1.0.0"}
# The device answered within one second with `work_start` (content `action:10`,
# `reason:2`) then `liquid_reset_over`, and its `sprayResetTime` became the
# moment of the reset. So the N60 countdown is `sprayResetTime` -- note the
# event is named for the liquid while the field is named for the spray.
#
# Code 8 is CONTRADICTED for the N50, and `reset_n50` is very likely a no-op.
# Resetting the N50 from PetKit's app was watched on the wire twice: the cloud
# sent ONLY `thing.service.errState {"show":1,"err_state":1}` -- never a `start`,
# never code 8 -- and the box answered nothing. Sending code 8 ourselves to the
# same box also drew no reply, where code 10 produced two events in a second.
# PetKit's own `dev_device_info` carries no N50 field at all, so the replacement
# date lives in their account database and the box is only told what to display.
# The button is left exposed because the enum comes from pypetkitapi, which
# models PetKit's CLOUD api where an N50 reset is a real call -- but on the
# device protocol it has no evidenced counterpart. Do not read its silence as a
# delivery failure, and do not build the N50 countdown on it.
