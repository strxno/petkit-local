"""HA MQTT-discovery model: `EntityDef` plus the payload/topic builders.

Every entity this add-on exposes is declared once as an `EntityDef` (see
`ha/entities/`), and this module is the single place that turns such a
declaration into the JSON Home Assistant's MQTT integration expects. Keeping
the translation here — rather than spelling out discovery dicts per entity —
is what makes ~474 entities across 13 device types tractable, and it is where
the hard-won rules about what HA actually accepts are recorded: several
comments below document discovery payloads that HA *silently* rejects, which
is indistinguishable from "the entity never appeared".

The unit tests never render these templates — only Home Assistant does, with
its own Jinja globals and entity state — so any change to the templates built
here has to be checked against `ha core logs` on a live install.

@dataclass
class EntityDef:
    """Declarative definition of one Home Assistant entity.

    An `EntityDef` is transport-agnostic: it says what the entity IS, while
    this module decides which topics it uses and `ha/commands.py` decides what
    a write to it does. The lists in `ha/entities/` are plain module-level
    constants, so instances are effectively shared singletons — treat them as
    immutable, never mutate one per device.

    Invariant: `key` must be unique across ALL components of a single device,
    not just within its own component. `unique_id` is derived from the key
    alone, and HA requires it to be globally unique.

    Fields:
        component: HA MQTT platform — sensor, binary_sensor, switch, button,
            number, select, text, event or image. It selects the
            per-component branch in `build_discovery_payload` and appears in
            the discovery topic, so an unknown value yields a bare sensor-like
            payload HA will ignore.
        key: stable slug identifying the entity within its device. Also the
            `payload_press` a button publishes, which is how `ha/commands.py`
            looks the action up in `ALL_ACTIONS`.
        name: human-readable name shown in HA.
        value_path: dot path into the state document published by
            `HAPublisher._build_state` (e.g. `state.sandPercent`,
            `settings.autoWork`, `capabilities.fullVideo`). Empty means the
            whole payload is the value. For settable entities the LAST segment
            doubles as the device settings field written back — see
            `setting_field`.
        device_class: HA device class. `timestamp` additionally changes how
            the value template renders an unset value (see `_value_template`).
        unit: `unit_of_measurement`.
        icon: mdi icon name, used when no device class implies one.
        entity_category: "config" or "diagnostic" to demote the entity out of
            the device's primary controls; empty for a primary entity.
        options: select option LABELS, or — for an `event` entity — the list of
            event_types HA should accept, or — for a `sensor` — the labels a
            raw device enum decodes to (see `_value_template`). Only select and
            event put them in the discovery payload; a sensor's are used by the
            value template alone, so HA never validates against them.
        option_values: device-side values corresponding 1:1 to `options`, for
            selects whose device enum is not a plain 0-based index (e.g. the
            minute intervals 0/5/10/15...). Empty means "use the option index".
        min_value, max_value, step: `number` bounds.
        payload_on, payload_off: `switch` payloads, used for BOTH the command
            payload and the state HA matches against.
