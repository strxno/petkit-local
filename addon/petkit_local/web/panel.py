"""The add-on's own web panel: HTTP routes plus the JSON API behind them.

This is the operator-facing side of petkit-local, next to (but separate from)
the device-facing API in `http/`. It covers real-device bring-up and day-to-day
control:

* **Devices** — one expandable panel per device from the live `DeviceRegistry`, per-device readable state
  resolved through the same dotted `value_path` HA uses, editable controls and a
  manual command sender (`api_devices`, `api_device_detail`, `api_send_command`).
* **Log** — the in-memory `EventHub` ring of HTTP+MQTT traffic, polled
  (`api_events`) or streamed over a WebSocket (`api_ws`).
* **Timeline** — visit sessions grouped at query time out of the `EventStore`,
  with their media (`api_timeline`).
* **Media** — files and thumbnails out of the friendly media tree
  (`api_media_file`, `api_media_thumb`) and the retention caps (`api_retention`).
* **Settings** — the runtime settings that can be flipped without a restart
  (`api_settings`), plus per-device capability/AI toggles.
* **Patchers** — apply/remove the on-device binary patches (`api_patcher_*`),
  which run as long-lived background tasks and report progress via the hub.
* **Pets** — CRUD and reference face photos for on-device recognition
  (`api_pets_*`).
* **Provisioning** — the Web Bluetooth page is pure frontend; it talks to the
  device directly from the browser, so there is no route for it here.

Serving
-------
`create_panel_app` builds one `web.Application` that main.py mounts on plain
HTTP `web_port` (8099) — what Home Assistant Ingress proxies into the sidebar,
and which can optionally be mapped to the LAN as an unauthenticated debug port.
It is therefore reachable unauthenticated whenever that mapping exists, hence
the caller-supplied limits below being clamped and every path built from
request input going through `utils/paths.safe_join`.

There used to be a second, self-signed HTTPS site on 8098 so Web Bluetooth had
a top-level secure context. It was removed: it published this entire API — every
device setting, command, pet record and on-device patcher — to the LAN with no
authentication, in exchange for a convenience the operator can provide safely
with their own certificate in front of `web_port`.

Frontend
--------
The single-page app itself is no longer inlined here: `templates/index.html` is
rendered by `handle_index` and links `static/app.js` + `static/styles.css`, both
shipped inside the package (see `TEMPLATE_DIR` / `STATIC_DIR`). The JS consumes
the exact key names the handlers below emit, so response shapes are a contract:
adding a key is safe, renaming or removing one is not.

    `add_static` sends `ETag` and `Last-Modified` but no `Cache-Control`, and a

    reuse WITHOUT asking, for a heuristic period derived from how old
    `Last-Modified` is. The practical effect after an add-on update is that the

    invisible, with nothing in the logs to say so.

    `no-cache` does not mean "do not store": the file stays cached and the
    conditional request still answers 304 from the ETag, so this costs one
    round trip per asset, not a re-download.

    it used to be covered only when the path happened to end in a slash, which
    depends on how Ingress routed the request. Cache-busting defends an asset

    The template links its assets with RELATIVE URLs (`static/...`), which is
    what makes the panel work behind Home Assistant Ingress: the page is only
    ever routed at `/`, so the browser's document path always ends in a slash
    and a relative asset resolves under whatever opaque
    `/api/hassio_ingress/<token>/` prefix Ingress happens to be using. An
    absolute `/static/...` would escape that prefix and 404.

    `no-cache` is set here rather than left to `_no_heuristic_caching`'s path
    match, because this is the one response that must never be reused without
    asking: it is what names the asset URLs, so a stale copy of it re-requests
    the old ones and defeats the content hash entirely.
