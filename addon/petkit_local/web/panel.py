"""The add-on's own web panel: the application object and its route table.

This is the composition root. `create_panel_app` hangs every collaborator on
`app[...]` — the keys are listed in `web/appkeys.py` — and registers every route
in one function; the handlers themselves live in `web/api/`, whose package
docstring carries the per-tab map of what the panel does.

The table stays whole because three of its registrations are ordering-critical
and say so inline. Distributed over ten modules, "registered before" stops being
a property anybody can check.

Serving
-------
`create_panel_app` builds one `web.Application` that main.py mounts on plain
HTTP `web_port` (8099) — what Home Assistant Ingress proxies into the sidebar,
and which can optionally be mapped to the LAN as an unauthenticated debug port.
It is therefore reachable unauthenticated whenever that mapping exists, hence
the caller-supplied limits below being clamped and every path built from
request input going through `utils/paths.safe_join`.

There used to be a second, self-signed HTTPS site on 8098 so Web Bluetooth had
a top-level secure context. It was removed: it published this entire API — every
device setting, command, pet record and on-device patcher — to the LAN with no
authentication, in exchange for a convenience the operator can provide safely
with their own certificate in front of `web_port`.

Frontend
--------
The single-page app itself is no longer inlined here: `templates/index.html` is
rendered by `handle_index` and links `static/js/main.js` (an ES module, which
imports the rest of `static/js/`) + `static/styles.css`, both shipped inside
the package (see `TEMPLATE_DIR` / `STATIC_DIR`). The JS consumes
the exact key names the handlers in `web/api/` emit, so response shapes are a
contract: adding a key is safe, renaming or removing one is not.
