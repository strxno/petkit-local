"""What more than one of the panel's API modules needs.

Two kinds of thing live here. The first is the reading end of the `app[...]`
contract (`web/appkeys.py`) plus the request parsers every handler starts with:
the `{id}` segment, the JSON body, `?limit=`, and the JSON refusal they raise.
The second is the handful of helpers two endpoints must not answer differently
— `_deliver` (the MQTT-or-heartbeat fallback every panel write takes) and the
pet lookups the Timeline shares with the Pets tab.

A helper only one module uses belongs in that module, not here.
