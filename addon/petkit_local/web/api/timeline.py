"""The Timeline tab: one local day of grouped sessions, and one event's detail.

`api_timeline` groups the day in Python at query time (`events/sessions.py`) and
renders every label through `events/decode.py`, which is why the device codename
has to reach every call — a numeric code means different things on a litter box
and on a feeder.

`api_event_detail` backs the Debug info expander on a card. It is served
per-event rather than inlined above because every event carries a state snapshot
averaging 1.2 kB.
