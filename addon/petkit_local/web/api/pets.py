"""Pets: CRUD, the reference photos a device's NPU matches against, and import.

The photos are the point. A pet row on its own does nothing; what makes
recognition work is the JPEGs `dev_discern_pic` serves to the device, so this
module owns storing them, serving them back to the panel, and fetching the ones
the PetKit account already holds.

Import is a button, never a poller. A pet arrives under a NEW local id with
PetKit's own id bound as an alias, because that foreign id is what a box still
