// The panel's entry point. index.html loads THIS file and nothing else, as a
// `<script type="module">`; every other module is reached from here, so there
// is no classic script on the page and no global namespace to collide in.
//
// The map:
//   core       BASE, api(), esc, the formatters, toast, copyText
//   delegate   the [data-action]/[data-change]/[data-input]/[data-toggle]
//              tables, the document listeners, and the section registry
//   format     one entity value, rendered the way Home Assistant renders it
//   help       the `?` chips and their popover
//   nav        the tab bar; each tab's loader lives in its own module
//   devices    the device panels, their state, and the refresh scheduler
//   entities   entityTable / controlRow — the rows a panel is built from
//   commands   the write path: a control becomes a POST (cf. ha/commands.py)
//   schedules  the schedule editors, registered into the devices panel
//   log        the live traffic log, and the devRun.log the device uploads
//   ws         the WebSocket that drives every live refresh
//   capture · setup · patchers · provision   one tab each
//   timeline   the day view; media  the thumbnails, player and gallery
//   insights   per-pet visit metrics; charts  the hand-rolled SVG it draws
//   pets       the AI/Pets tab; cropper  the mugshot cropper it opens
//
// SECURITY INVARIANT, and the reason the split changes nothing about it:
// `esc` in core.js is the ONE escape, markup is built as strings and assigned
// through innerHTML, and there is not a single inline `on*=` handler attribute
// anywhere in these files — behaviour is bound once at the document root and
// looked up by name in the delegation table, so nothing device-supplied ever
// reaches a place the browser would parse as code. See the comment above `esc`.

// Is this page the one the server would serve now?

// The Setup tab already shows the running version, and it answers a different
// question: it comes from `/api/info`, so it reports the SERVER's build. A
// fresh server behind a stale page reports the new number while running the old
// code, which is exactly the case that keeps costing an afternoon — a fix is
// deployed, served, and the panel quietly goes on doing the old thing with
// nothing anywhere to say so.
