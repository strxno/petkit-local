"""poll/{type}/heartbeat — the device's ~15s poll, and how commands reach it.

This is the slow but always-available command channel. The device asks "anything
for me?" every few seconds over plain HTTP; whatever is in its `command_queue`
comes back in the response and is executed. MQTT delivers the same commands
instantly, but only to a device whose `ctrl` binary trusts our broker, so the
heartbeat is the path that works on stock firmware and the fallback when MQTT
is down.

Producers therefore enqueue in MQTT envelope form and let this module translate:
`ha/publisher.py` falls back to the queue whenever the device has no live MQTT
session, and `web/panel.py` queues the same envelopes. `_to_heartbeat_content`
converts them to the flat `{msgType, payload, type, timestamp}` object the HTTP
path expects, so a caller never has to know which channel will carry its
command. (`patchers/common.py` is the exception: it queues an already-serialized
string, which passes straight through.)

The poll is also where we find out that the *other* channel died: the device
reports its own MQTT state in `?iotStatus=`, and `note_iot_status` is what stops
a lost session from swallowing commands forever.

`carries_commands` lives here too, because it is the same concern seen from the
other side: in proxy mode every other endpoint's local answer is discarded in
favour of the cloud's, but this one has already spent the queue to build itself,
so a reply that is delivering something is sent as-is and never forwarded.

What the device does with the answer, read out of `net_http_heartbeat` (D4SH
867) and its ARM twin (W7H 456), because every rule here is invisible from our
end -- a rejected entry produces no reply, no error and no retry:

  * `result[]` entries carry `time` (ms), `timestamp` (s) and `content`.
  * An entry whose `timestamp` is not greater than the last consumed one is
    discarded as already seen.
  * An entry with `time/1000 - timestamp >= 61` is discarded as expired, on an
    unsigned compare -- so a `timestamp` ahead of `time` expires immediately.
  * `content.msgType` may be 0, 1 or 2. Nothing else is dispatched.

    This is the backstop, not the primary: `mqtt/auth.py` clears the flag the
    moment a session ends. What that hook cannot see is a session that ended
    without the broker noticing — a device that reboots or drops off Wi-Fi
