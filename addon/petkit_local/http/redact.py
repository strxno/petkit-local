"""What a proxied cloud response is allowed to contain by the time a device sees it.

Proxy mode forwards everything, so the upstream — PetKit's real cloud — gets to
put a body in front of firmware we are meant to be shielding. This module is the
one place that decides what survives that trip.

**Content-keyed, not endpoint-keyed.** There is deliberately no list of "safe
endpoints": every rule matches on the SHAPE of a decoded object wherever it
appears, so an `apiServers` block returned from an endpoint nobody expected it
on is caught anyway. The walker also descends into JSON encoded as a *string*,
which is how the heartbeat carries its commands and how the old
`_strip_run_cmd` was able to see only that one case.

Two very different kinds of rule live here, and the difference is what
`BLOCKING_RULES` encodes:

* **Routine substitutions** (`server`, `mqtt`, `oss_sts`) replace the cloud's
  address with ours. They fire constantly, on every `dev_serverinfo` and
  `dev_device_info` poll, and mean nothing except "proxy mode is on". They are
  logged, not persisted. `locale` is a routine substitution (`server` and
  `mqtt` are the others), not in `BLOCKING_RULES` — `dev_device_info` is
  polled often and a row per poll would bury the attempts that matter.
* **Blocked attempts** (`rce`, `ota`, `secret`) mean the upstream tried to run a
  command, push firmware, or re-credential the device. These are rare, and each
  one is persisted (`events/models.py::BlockedAttempt`).

The values every substitution uses come from `Device.to_*` — the same methods
that build our own responses — so a redacted body cannot drift from the body the
local handler would have produced.
